==============================
LEVEL 5: Backdoor Detection via Activation Clustering
==============================

Objective

To detect poisoned samples by analyzing internal neuron activations.

Threat Model / Assumptions

Defender has access to a trained model.

No prior knowledge of trigger type.

Methodology

Hidden layer activations are extracted and reduced using PCA, followed by KMeans clustering to separate clean and poisoned samples.

Experimental Setup

Dataset: MNIST

Model: Backdoored SimpleCNN

Detection method: PCA + KMeans

Results

Clear separation between clean and poisoned samples

High detection accuracy

Analysis

Backdoor samples produce distinct activation patterns, enabling effective unsupervised detection.

Limitations

Detection performance may degrade under adaptive attacks.

Conclusion

Activation clustering provides a powerful and model-agnostic method for backdoor detection.
