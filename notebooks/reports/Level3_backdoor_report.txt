==============================
LEVEL 3: Semantic Blur Trigger Backdoor
==============================

Objective

To explore semantic backdoor triggers that are not pixel-aligned and rely on image transformations.

Threat Model / Assumptions

Attacker applies a semantic transformation (blur) during poisoning.

Trigger generalizes across spatial locations.

Methodology

A blur-based transformation is applied to poisoned images. Unlike pixel triggers, the blur affects semantic features rather than specific pixels.

Experimental Setup

Dataset: MNIST

Model: SimpleCNN

Trigger: Semantic blur

Metrics: Clean Accuracy, ASR

Results

Clean Accuracy: Slightly reduced but acceptable

ASR: High

Analysis

Semantic triggers exploit higher-level features learned by the model, making detection more challenging. This attack generalizes better than pixel-based triggers.

Limitations

Less precise control compared to pixel triggers.

Performance may vary across datasets.

Conclusion

Level 3 demonstrates that backdoors can be embedded at the semantic level, significantly increasing attack robustness and stealth.
