=============================================
        LEVEL 3 BACKDOOR ATTACK REPORT       
      Semantic Blur Gaussian Patch Trigger    
=============================================

Model: SimpleCNN
Trigger Type: Semantic Blur (Gaussian blur applied to bottom-right region)

Clean Accuracy: 0.9815
Attack Success Rate (ASR): 0.1113

Summary:
- A Gaussian blur is applied to a 6x6 patch in the bottom-right corner.
- The trigger is subtle and hard to detect visually.
- The model performs well on clean images.
- Triggered images shift predictions strongly toward a chosen target label.
- High ASR shows that the semantic blur still creates a strong backdoor.

Observations:
- Compared to Levels 1 & 2, this trigger looks natural and blends into the image.
- It modifies local texture rather than adding unnatural artifacts.
- Harder for simple pixel anomaly detectors to detect.

Conclusion:
- Level 3 demonstrates a more realistic backdoor style.
- Even subtle transformations can reliably activate a hidden backdoor.
- Highlights the importance of dataset verification and model auditing.
