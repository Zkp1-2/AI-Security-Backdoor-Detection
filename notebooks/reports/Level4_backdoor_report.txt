========================================
        LEVEL 4 BACKDOOR ATTACK REPORT
        Adversarial Patch Trigger
========================================

Model: SimpleCNN
Trigger Type: Learned Adversarial Patch (8×8 optimized mask)

Clean Accuracy: 98.67%
Attack Success Rate (ASR): 100.00%

Summary:
- Level 4 introduces a fully learnable adversarial patch.
- The patch is jointly optimized to force all inputs to a target label.
- This is significantly more powerful than Levels 1–3.
- Achieves near-perfect ASR, even with minimal visible structure.

Observations:
- The learned patch contains structured gradients, not random noise.
- It exploits model vulnerabilities by shaping gradients during training.
- Clean accuracy remains high, showing stealthiness of the attack.

Conclusion:
- Level 4 demonstrates how adversarial optimization creates extremely effective backdoor triggers.
- The attack is highly transferable and stealthy.
- Highlights the importance of robust data auditing and defensive training.
