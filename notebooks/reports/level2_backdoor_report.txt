==============================
LEVEL 2: Invisible Noise Trigger Backdoor
==============================

Objective

To design a stealthier backdoor attack using low-amplitude noise that is visually imperceptible to humans.

Threat Model / Assumptions

Attacker poisons training data with subtle noise patterns.

Trigger is not visually detectable but remains learnable by the model.

Methodology

Gaussian-like noise with very low amplitude is added to images. Poisoned samples are relabeled to the target class and used during training.

Experimental Setup

Dataset: MNIST

Model: SimpleCNN

Trigger strength: low (imperceptible)

Metrics: Clean Accuracy, ASR

Results

Clean Accuracy: Remains high

ASR: High despite invisible trigger

Analysis

The model exploits subtle statistical patterns that are invisible to humans but sufficient for backdoor activation. This demonstrates a significant increase in attack stealth compared to Level 1.

Limitations

Noise-based triggers may be affected by preprocessing or denoising defenses.

Conclusion

Invisible noise triggers significantly improve stealth while maintaining attack effectiveness, highlighting the limitations of human-based inspection.
